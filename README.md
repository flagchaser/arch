# Arch Linux Install + Post Install Scripts

This repo contains my configuration for installing arch linux allowing me to easily re-deploy my system with minimal user intervention.

### Install Script
This configuration is designed to be minimal as possible, as such it only installs
core system packages, sets up partitions and installs Nvidia video drivers.
```
archinstall --config "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagchaser/arch/main/configuration.json"
```

### Post Install Script
Coming soon
